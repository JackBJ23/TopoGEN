# TopoGEN

This project presents new regularizers relying on persistence homology. We apply these loss functions in two types of experiments: 1) Synthetic experiments for validation, 2) Implementation in a VAE, 3) Implementation in a GAN. A visualization of the effect of applying the LB function of a point cloud is shown in the gif below.
