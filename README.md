# TopoGEN

Generative models enhanced with persistent homology

This project presents new regularizers relying on the comparison of persistence diagrams. We apply these loss terms in two types of experiments: 1) Synthetic experiments with 2D point clouds, 2) Implementation in a VAE, 3) Implementation in a GAN. A visualization of the effect of applying the LB function on a point cloud is shown in the gif below. ![](https://github.com/JackBJ23/TopoGEN/test1_gif.gif)
